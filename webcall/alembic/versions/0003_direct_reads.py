OBSOLETE STUB: Duplicate migration file left intentionally empty.

This file previously conflicted with 0004_direct_reads.py (same revision id).
It is now a no-op without Alembic revision metadata so Alembic will ignore it.
Safe to delete in a future cleanup.

# No Alembic revision variables here on purpose.
